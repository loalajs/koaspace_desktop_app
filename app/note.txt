- Sync the file to the S3 by specifying the file full path
2.3 For delete a file
- Listen unlink event and sync the s3
- delete the file in the local database ( Milestone 2 )
2.4 Change a file

Program Technical Part
=============================================
1. Use promise based wrapper for files watching
2. Need to close file watcher when program close
